> :space_invader: Fractal mathematics and visualization API

---

fractule is an attempt to establish a human-friendly programming API for defining, visualizing, analyzing and interacting with fractal / chaotic functions.

It is strongly influenced by [Playing with Chaos](http://www.playingwithchaos.net/) by Keith Peters, an incredible and intuitive introduction to coding fractal equations.

fractule will eventually extend beyond this work in order to help establish the real-world scientific uses of fractals, particularly in the world of physics. This includes but is not limited to:

* Logarithmic analysis
* Multi-fractal analysis
* Fractal dimension analysis
* Non-deterministic fractals
* Heterogenous fractals
* Bifurcations
* Distributions

## API

This API is certainly bound to change, but it currently defines an SVG-based interface for preparing, scaling, transforming and rendering fractal shapes.  Although the visualization API described below will slowly evolve, most of the additional work will be towards the mathematics API (which as of now, is really just `dimension`):

* `iterate`

  Kicks off the fractal iteration process

* `iteration`

  Called on each depth iteration of a fractal

* `translate`

  Prepares the fractal by translating its position

* `drawUnit`

  Invokes the overall drawing process of a single fractal unit

* `setupUnit`

  Prepares a fractal unit context for rendering (typically `this.context.save()`)

* `scaleUnit`

  Returns a scaled size based on the current depth, size and angle of a fractal unit

* `directUnit`

  Prepares a fractal unit for movement by changing its direction / rotating it

* `moveUnit`

  Changes the position of the fractal unit context according to the scale

* `renderUnit`

  Render the fractal unit as an SVG stroke

* `exitUnit`

  Cleanup step that gets called after a fractal unit is successfully rendered

* `distance`

  Determines the Euclidean distance between two points (utility function)

* `clear`

  Clears out a canvas that may have one or more fractals on it. Supports a custom fill color

## Install

`npm install slurmulon/fractule`

## Examples

As of now, every fractal visualization generate by fractule can be viewed at the [Playing with Chaos](http://www.playingwithchaos.net) home page.

If you would like to run the examples generated by fractule, it's as simple as configuring and running:

```js
import { TreeFractal } from 'fractule'

const tree = new TreeFractal({
  scale   : .5,
  epsilon : .5,
  depth   : 2,
  height  : 600, // defaults to window.innerHeight
  width   : 800  // defaults to window.innerWidth
})

tree.randomize()
tree.draw()
```

should give you something like this:
